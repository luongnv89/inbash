# inbash
Bash scripts to do some work

- `basic.sh` - Install basic packages: `vim`, `git`, `wget`

- `show_ip_login.sh` - Show IP address in login screen (for `ssh` uses). Need to go with `show_ip`

- `update_network_interfaces.sh` - Add `eth1` as new network interface and bring it up. More interfaces can be added in file `interfaces`. When you add more network interfaces, you need to maintain this script to bring up more network interfaces

- `c_pp.sh` - Install some package for developing c/c++ : `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, `cmake`
